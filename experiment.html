Our device released different Outputs in order depending on the information of Input. It was proved by two experimental results of electrophoresis (Fig.1 and Fig.2) where we add two types of Inputs (<font color="DB0015">A</font> then <font color="6BBF3F">B</font>, <font color="6BBF3F">B</font> then <font color="DB0015">A</font>).Both of Output-A and B were tagged with TAMRA. We conducted quantitative analysis of the band intensity of Outputs based on the result of electrophoresis.
Following graphs show the ratio of Outputs to the total intensity of 2 bands (Transducer, Output) on each lane. <br>

All enzymes and DNAs (Transducer, Gate) were mixed at 45 &#08451 , then the reaction starts by adding Input. Reaction times were 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 100 min. After the reaction, the temperature was heated up to 80 &#08451 to stop enzymes activities, then cooled down to the room temperature.

In this experimental result, the time series variation of Outputs proved that our device releases Outputs in order.
The order of Outputs changed depending on the information of input. Both graphs show that saturated time of the first and the second Output was 2 and 20 minutes. Thus, both time intervals were about 18 minutes. The ratio of Outputs was saturated around 90 %.<br>

In the <a href>discussion page</a>, we are going to discuss the difference between this experimental result (Fig.2) and simulation.<br>

Reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration, and time were determined by preliminary experiment of components reactions in advance to the experiment in the previous section. DNA strands and enzymes for experiment were carefully designed and chosen.(For the details check <a href>Method and Material page</a>.)<br>

This process should work if Input, Template, Polymerase, Nickase, and dNTP are all in the same solution. If this process works properly, the signal will be amplified.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown right. 
The band of Signal strand appeared on lane2 while that did not appear on lane3. Unlike lane1, Signal strand was not contained in the sample of lane3. The band of Signal strand appeared by the function of Polymerase and Nickase. Reading process works precisely when the reaction temperature is 37 &#08451; ~45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, existing Output should be released by both the hybridization of Signal strand and the displacement of polymerase.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown right. Output did not appear on lane1 in which Signal was not contained. Output appeared on lane2 and lane3 in which Signal was contained. From this result, we can conclude that Releasing process works correctly. Lane2 and lane3 differ on the reaction temperature, the band of Output appeared on both lane2 and lane3. Releasing process would work precisely when the reaction temperature is between 37 &#08451;  and 45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, Updater is released by both the hybridization of Signal and the displacement of polymerase. Recognition sequence is formed by the hybridization of Updater and Input, and then EcoRI cuts the Input.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown right. From the result of lane1 and lane2, we found that Updated complex and Waste are generated when Signal is entered. Therefore, Updating process works correctly by the function of EcoRI and Polymerase.<br>

3 processes with Polymerase, Nickase, and restriction enzyme need to work in the same H buffer as we designed. The release of first output was confirmed in this overall device. In addition, how long did it take to release first Output was evaluated by this experiment. Therefore, enzymatic reaction times were set variously. The release of the first output corresponds to Input-AB, that is Output-A, was confirmed in this experiment. Output-A is modified with fluorescent molecule TAMRA. Before stained by SYBR Gold, a band contains Output-A (Transducer, Output) must be able to be observed.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

Fluorescent intensity of Output was increased as reaction time became longer. Output was saturated about 10 minutes later. Therefore, we concluded that it takes about 5~10 minutes for our device to release first Output.<br>
Figure below shows the result of electrophoresis above. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold.<br>

When reaction time is over 20 minutes, Signal band emerged. 
The reason can be thought that Output discharged in Releasing process saturated, and Signal exceeded. 
This excess Signal is used in next Updating process. <br>

It is necessary to confirm that enzyme free device we designed really releases Output depends on Input sequences in order. This experiment measures the intensity of Output-A modified with FAM. We prepared Input-AB and Input-BA.  The order of releasing would be changed depending on these Inputs if our device works properly.<br>
Following graph shows the time series variation of Output-A.<br>
<div align="center">

Fig.7 The intensity of Output-A (FAM) measured by spectrofluorometer.<br> <font size="-1">The fluorescence wavelength is 520nm. To do quantitative analysis the highest intensity data was defined 100% while the lowest was defined 0 %.</font><br>
</div>
<br>
According to the graph, the intensity of Output-A coded as second domain was increased later than that was first domain. Therefore, this result shows our device releases Output based on the code written in Input.
The time difference between first and second releasing is about 40 minutes.<br>
We are going to discuss about this result along with simulation in <a href="discussion.html">Discussion page</a>.

We checked the function of one seesaw gate by measuring fluorescence intensity and doing electrophoresis.<br>
If first Output is released, we can conclude that one Seesaw gate works properly. <br>

It is necessary for Output to be detected when it is released from Transducer. We prepared the DNA that hybridizes with Output previously modified with BHQ.

Input is designed to release A then B. The final concentration of all components (Input, Transducer, Gate, Trigger) were 100nM.<br>
Time evolution of fluorescence is shown in following figure. 0[s] is the time when Trigger was added into the solution where Input, Transducer, and Gate were mixed. <br>
<br>

</p>
<p>
To do quantitative analysis, 100% was defined the fluorescence intensity level of DNA modified FAM, and 0% was the level of the solution with Input, Transducer, and Gate. After adding Trigger, strength of fluorescence increased gradually. Therefore, Output-A was released by the function of the device properly. The increase of fluorescence stopped at about 1700sec. Probably the reaction ended at this point. Half of Output strands were released according to the fluorescence intensity.<br>

We also evaluated the ratio of first Output by electrophoresis to confirm the function of the seesaw gate.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

In two bands appeared on lane1 and lane3 in the figure, the upper one is Transducer, and the lower one is Output.  <br>
The fluorescence intensity of lane1 with Trigger is strong. <br>
Table.1 shows the results of measuring the fluorescence intensity of 2 bands in lane 1 and 3.<br>

<br>
Comparing lane1 (with Trigger) with lane3 (with no Trigger), the intensity of Output increased by 83.0%, and Transducer decreased 83.0% when Trigger was added. We can conclude that Output is released by Trigger.<br>
