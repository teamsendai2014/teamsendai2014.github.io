Our device released different Outputs in order depending on the information of Input. It was proved by two experimental results of electrophoresis (fig.1 and fig.2) where we add two types of Inputs (<font color="DB0015">A</font> then <font color="6BBF3F">B</font>, <font color="6BBF3F">B</font> then <font color="DB0015">A</font>).
</p>
<p>
The first experimental result shows the time difference between the first and the second Output.
The first Output should be released faster than the second one.
To detect the Output-A only, it was tagged with TAMRA (a fluorophore) while Output-B was modified with nothing.
Thus, only 2 bands, Output-A and Transducer-A, was detected before staining gel.
Reaction time was changed variously to evaluate time series variation of Output-A.
<br>
<div align="center">

<font size="-1">
All enzymes and DNAs (Transducer, Gate) were mixed at 45 &#08451 , then the reaction starts by adding Input. Reaction times were 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 100 min. After the reaction, the temperature was heated up to 80 &#08451 to stop enzymes activities, then cooled down to the room temperature.

</div>

<br>
The bands of Output A started to appear from 1~2 minutes with Input-<font color="DB0015">A</font><font color="6BBF3F">B</font> and from 12~15 minutes  with Input-<font color="6BBF3F">B</font><font color="DB0015">A</font>.
The time interval was about 10 minutes. This difference is only coused by the Input sequence. Therefore, we confirmed that our device releases Outputs in order with enough time interval.
</p>
<p>
In the second experimental result, the time series variation of Outputs proved that our device releases Outputs in order.
Both of Output-A and B were tagged with TAMRA.
We conducted quantitative analysis of the band intensity of Outputs based on the result of electrophoresis.
Following graphs show the raito of Outputs to the total intensity of 2 bands (Transducer, Output) on each lane. <br>

</div>
-->
<br>
The order of Outputs changed depending on the information of input. Both graphs show that sturated time of the first and the second Output was 2 and 20 minutes. Thus, both time intervals were about 18 minutes. The raito of Outputs were saturated aroud 90 %.<br>

<p>
Reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration, and time were determined by preriminaly expeiment of components reactions in advance to the experimnet in the previous section. DNA strands and enzymes for experiment were carefully designed and chosen.(For the details check <a href>Method and Material page</a>.)<br>
<br>

<span><h3 id="Reading Process ex">Reading Process</h3></span>
<p>
This process should work if Input, Template, Polymerase, Nickase, and dNTP are all in the same solution. If this process works properly, the signal will be amplified.<br>
</p>
<p>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

<p>
The band of Signal strand apperared on lane2 while that did not appear on lane3.
Unlike lane1, Signal strand was not contained in the sample of lane3. The band of Signal strand appeared by the function of Polymerase and Nickase. Reading process works precisely when the reaction temperature is 37 &#08451; ~45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, existing Output should be released by both the hybridization of Signal strand and the displacement of polymerase.<br>

<p>
Output did not appear on lane1 in which Signal was not contained. Output appeared on lane2 and lane3 in which Siganl was contained. From this result, we can conclude that Releasing process works correctly. Lane2 and lane3 differ on the reaction temperature, the band of Output appeared on both lane2 and lane3. Releasing process would work precisely when the reaction temperature is between 37 &#08451;  and 45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, Updater is released by both the hybridization of Signal and the displacement of polymerase. Recognition sequence is formed by the hybridization of Updater and Input, then EcoRI cuts the Input.<br>

3 processes with Polymerase, Nickase, and restriction enzyme need to work in the same H buffer as we designaed. The release of first output was confirmed in this overall device. In addition, how long did it take to release first Output was evaluated by this experiment.<br>
Therefore, enzymatic reaction times were set variously. <br>
The release of the first output correspond to Input-AB, that is Output-A, was confirmed in this experiment. Output-A is modified with fluorescent molecule TAMRA. Before stained by SYBR Gold, a band contains Output-A (Transducer, Output) must be able to be observed.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.

Fluorescent intensity of Output was increased as reaction time became longer. The result of lane8 can be regarded as an outcome when reaction time is 0 minutes. The graph above shows the ratio of fluorescence intensity of Output in lane 1 to 7, when the fluorescence intensity sum of Output and Transducer in each lanes set to 100%. Although about 10% of Output exists at the initial stage of reactions, it can be thought to be the Output that missed to form Transducer when annealing. Concentration of this Output must be able to decrease by refining the solution. Output was saturated about 10 minutes later. In the end, it became clear that 50 to 60% of fluorescent molecule exists from the first is released.<br>
</p>
<p>
Figure below shows the result of electrophoresis above. DNA is stained with SYBR Gold.<br>

When reaction time is over 20 minutes, Signal band emerged. 
The reason can be thought that Output discharged in Releasing process saturated, and Signal exceeded. 
This excess Signal is used in next Updating process. <br>

It is necessary to confirm that enzyme free device we designed really releases Output depends on Input sequences in order. This experiment measures the intensity of FAM (modified with Output-A). We prepared Input-AB and Input-BA.  The order of releasing would be changed depending on these Inputs if our device works properly.<br>
Following graph shows the result.<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment efs whole device spectro together_1.0.png" width="700"><br>
fig.12 The intensity of Output-A (FAM). The fluorescence wavelength is 520nm. To do quantitative analysis the highest intensity data was defined 100% while the lowest was defined 0 %.<br>
</div>
<br>
According to the left graph, the intensity of Output-A coded as second domain was increased later than that was first domain. Therefore, this result shows our device releases Output based on the code written in Input.
The time difference between first and second releasing is about 40 minutes.<br>
We are going to discuss about this result along with simulation.

<span><h2>Component (Seesaw gate)</h2></span>
<p>
We checked the function of one seesaw gate by measuring fluorescence intensity and doing electrophoresis.<br>
If first Output is released, we can conclude that one Seesaw gate works properly.
</p>





<span><h3 id="Measurement of fluorescence ex">Measurement of fluorescence</h3></span>
<p>
Output is modified with FAM. The DNA that hybridizes with Output previously is modified with BHQ. Click <a href>here</a> for more information about FRET. Input is designed to release A then B. FAM is modified with Output-A. The final concentration of all components (Input, Transducer, Gate, Trigger) are 100nM.<br>
Time change of fluorescence is shown in following figure.  0[s] is the time when Trigger was added into the solution in which Input, Transducer, and Gate were mixed. <br>
<br>

<div align="center">

fig.13 Time change of Output-A measured by spectrofluorometer<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
To do quantitative analysis, 100% was defined the fluorescence intensity level of DNA modified FAM, and 0% was the level of the solution with Input, Transducer, and Gate. After adding Trigger, strength of fluorescence increased gradually. Therefore, Output-A was released by the function of the device properly. The increase of fluorescence stopped at about 1700sec. Probably the reaction ended at this point. Half of Output strands were released according to the fluorescence intensity.<br>

We carried out the electrophoresis with FAM modified Output. Only Output can be observed with no coloring matter.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

In two bands appeared on lane1 and lane3 in the figure, the upper one is Transducer, and the lower one is Outout.  <br>
The fluorescence intensity of lane1 with Trigger is strong. <br>
On the figure, the results of measuring the fluorescence intensity of lane1 and lane3 are following table.<br>

<br>
Comparing lane1 (with Trigger) with lane3 (with no Trigger), the intensity of Output increased by 83.0%, and Transducer decreased 83.0% when Trigger was added. We can conclude that Output is released by Trigger.<br>
