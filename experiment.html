Our project is completed if our device releases different output depends on the order coded on Input. 
We confirmed that by electrophoresis with input that codes "A then B" and "B then A". DNA strands and enzymes were carefully designed and chosen.(For the details check <a href>Method and Material page</a>.)
TAMRA (a fluorescence molecule) was modified to Output A while nothing was modified to Output B.
Only 2 bands, Output A and Transducer A, can be detected before staining gel.
After stainig with SYBR Gold, bands which indicates Output B can be also observed.
All enzymes and sets of DNA (Transducer, Gate) were mixed at 45 &#08451; , then the reaction starts by adding Input.
Reaction time for operating the device was set variously (1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 100 min) to evaluete time variation of Output.
After that, the temperature was heated up to 80 &#08451;  to stop enzymes working then cooled down to the room temperature.

The result with <font size="+2"><B>Input AB</B></font> is following fig.1. That had not stained yet.<br>

</div>
<br>
The band intnsity of Output A increases between 1~2 min while that of Transducer A decreases.<br>
In the next result, all condition is same to fig.1 except for the Input sequence. That is changed to <font size="+2"><B>Input BA</B></font>.<br>
<br>

fig.2 Time variation of Output A with <font size="+2"><B>Input BA</B></font> (before staining)<br>
</div>
<br>
The band of Output A can be observed from 12~15 min. Therefore, the Output A releasing time is later than the case of Input AB.<br>
In addition, following graph shows the raito of Output A to the total fluorescence (intensity Transducer A + Output A) with various reaction times. That raito is based on the band intensity shown in above 2 gel images.<br>
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment es second output electrophoresis before output A graph_1.0.png" width="700"><br>
fig.3 The raito of Output A with various reaction times<br>
</div>
<br>
First domain Output is released at 2 min while second domain is released at 20min. Thus, time interval of them is about 18 minutes. The raito of Output A is saturated aroud 70 % because Output A with TAMARA would form Transducer A again when the solution cooled down from 80 &#08451;  to room tempereature.<br> In the <a href>discussion page</a>, we are going to discuss about the differnce between this experimental result and simulation result.<br>
The follwing 2 images shows stained gels of fig.1 and fig.2.<br>

</div>
<br>
The band intensity of Output coded as second domain increased gradually after the increassing of first domain. This difference is coursed by the sequences of Input only. Therefore, we confirmed the whole function of our device that releases Output depending on the codes written in Input by this experiment.<br>

<span><h2>Components (3 processes)</h2></span>






<span><h3>Reading Process</h3></span>
<p>
This process should work if Input, Template, Polymerase, Nickase, and dNTP are all in the same solution. If this process works properly, the signal will be amplified.<br>
</p>
<p>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment reading process eido_1.0.png" width="500"><br>
fig.6 Confirmation of Reading process<br>
Other components include Input/Template complex, Polymerase, Nickase, and dNTP.<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
The band of Signal strand apperared on lane2 while that did not appear on lane3.
Unlike lane1, Signal strand was not contained in the sample of lane3. We can conclude that the band of Signal strand appeared by the function of Polymerase and Nickase.
We can also conclude that Reading process works precisely when the reaction temperature is 37 &#08451; ~45 &#08451; .<br>
</p>
<p>
Method and Materials<br>
</p>





<span><h3>Releasing Process</h3></span>
<p>
In this process, existing Output should be released by both the hybridization of Signal strand and the displacement of polymerase.<br>
</p>
<p>
The results of electrophoresis are shown below.<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment releasing process eido_1.0.png" width="500"><br>
fig.7 Confirmation of Releasing process<br>
Other components include Output transducer, Polymerase, and dNTP.<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Output did not appear on lane1 in which Signal was not contained. Output appeared on lane2 and lane3 in which Siganl was contained. From this result, we can conclude that Releasing process works correctly. Lane2 and lane3 differ on the reaction temperature, the band of Output appeared on both lane2 and lane3. Releasing process works precisely when the reaction temperature is between 37 &#08451;  and 45 &#08451; .<br>
</p>
<p>
Method and Materials
</p>







<span><h3>Updating Process</h3></span>
<p>
In this process, Updater is released by both the hybridization of Signal and the displacement of polymerase. Recognition sequence is formed by the hybridization of Updater and Input, then EcoRI cuts the Input.<br>
</p>
<p>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment updating process eido_1.0.png" width="600"><br>
fig.8 Confirmation of Updating process<br>
Other components include Input, Gate, Polymerase, EcoRI, and dNTP.<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
From the result of lane1 and lane2, we found that Updated complex and Waste are generated when Signal is entered. Therefore, Updating process works correctly by the function of EcoRI and Polymerase.<br>
</p>
<p>
Method and Materials
</p>






<span><h3>Combination of 3 processes</h3></span>
<p>
3 processes with Polymerase, Nickase, and restriction enzyme need to work in the same buffer as we designaed. The release of first output was confirmed in this overall device. In addition, how long did it take to release first Output must be evaluated.<br>
Therefore, samples after various enzyme reaction times were done electrophoresis. <br>
The release of the first output correspond to Input A then B, that is Output A, was confirmed in this experiment. Output A is modified with fluorescent molecule TAMRA. Before stained by SYBR Gold, a band contains Output A (Output Transducer, Output Strand) must be able to be observed.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.

</p>
<p>
Fluorescent intensity of Output was increased as reaction time became longer. <br>
The result of Lane8 can be regarded as an outcome when reaction time is 0 minutes. <br>
The graph above shows the ratio of fluorescence intensity of Output in Lane 2 to 8, when the fluorescence intensity sum of Output and Transducer in Lane8 is set to100%. <br>
Although about 10% of Output exists at the initial stage of reactions, it can be thought to be the Output that missed to hybridize with Holder when annealing. <br>
Concentration of this Output must be able to decrease by refining the solution. <br>
Output saturated about 10 minutes later. In the end, it became clear that 50 to 60% of fluorescent molecule exists from the first is released. <br>
</p>
<p>
Figure below shows the result of electrophoresis above. DNA is stained with SYBR Gold.

<br>
</div>
When reaction time is over 20 minutes, Signal band emerged. <br>
The reason can be thought that Output discharged in Releasing Process saturated, and Signal exceeded. <br>
This excess Signal is used in next Updating Process. <br>

<span><h2>Whole device</h2></span>
<p>
It is necessary to confirm that enzyme free device we designed really releases Output depends on Input sequences in order. This experiment measures the intensity of FAM (modified with Output A). We prepared Input AB and Input BA.  The order of releasing would be changed depending on these Inputs if our device works properly.<br>
Following graph shows the result.<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment efs whole device spectro together_1.0.png" width="700"><br>
fig.12 The intensity of Output A (FAM). The fluorescence wavelength is 520nm.<br>
</div>
<br>
According to the left graph, the intensity of Output A coded as second domain was increased later when that was first domain. Therefore, this result show our device releases Output based on the code written in Input.
The time difference between first and second releasing is about 40 minutes.<br>
</p>

<section id="contents06">
<span><h2>Component (Seesaw gate)</h2></span>
<p>
We checked the function of one seesaw gate by measuring fluorescence intensity and doing electrophoresis.<br>
</p>





<span><h3>Measurement of fluorescence</h3></span>
<p>
Output is modified with FAM. The DNA that hybridizes with Output previously is modified with BHQ. Click <a href>here</a> for more information about FRET. Input is designed to release A then B. FAM is modified with Output A. The final concentration of all components (Input, Transducer, Gate, Trigger) are 100nM.<br>
Time change of fluorescence is shown in following figure.  0[s] is the time when Trigger was added into the solution in which Input, Transducer, and Gate were mixed. <br>
<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/experiment/experiment efs seesaw 1stoutputdetecting spectro_1.0.png" width="650"><br>
fig.13 Time change of Output A measured by spectrofluorometer<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
To do quantitative analysis, 100% was defined the fluorescence intensity level of DNA modified FAM, and 0% was the level of the solution with Input, Transducer, and gate. After adding Trigger, strength of fluorescence increased gradually. Therefore, Output A was released by the function of the device properly. The increase of fluorescence stopped at about 1700sec. Probably the reaction ended at this point. Half of Output strands were released according to the fluorescence intensity.<br>
</p>
<p>

<span><h3>Electrophoresis</h3></span>
<p>
We carried out the electrophoresis with FAM modified Output. Only Output can be observed with no coloring matter.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

<br>
In two bands appeared on lane1 and lane3 in the figure, the upper one is Transducer, and the lower one is Outout.  <br>
The fluorescence intensity of lane1 with Trigger is strong. <br>
On the figure, the results of measuring the fluorescence intensity of lane1 and lane3 are following table.<br>

<br>
Comparing lane1 (with Trigger) with lane3 (with no Trigger), the intensity of Output increased by 83.0%, and Transducer decreased 83.0% when Trigger was added. We can conclude that Output is released by Trigger.<br>
