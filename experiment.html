<!--<h3>The order of releasing</h3>-->
<p>
Our device releases different Outputs in order depending on the information of Input. It was proved by two experimental results of electrophoresis (Fig.1) where we add two types of Inputs (<font color="DB0015">A</font> then <font color="6BBF3F">B</font>, <font color="6BBF3F">B</font> then <font color="DB0015">A</font>). Both Output-A and B were tagged with TAMRA, though the length of two Outputs is different. We conducted quantitative analyses of the band intensity of Outputs based on the result of electrophoresis. Following graphs show the ratio of Outputs to the total intensity of 2 bands (Transducer, Output) on each lane. <br>
<br>

All enzymes and DNAs (Transducer, Gate) were mixed at 45 &#08451 , then the reactions start when Input is added. Reaction times were 0, 1/6, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 min. After the reaction, the temperature was heated up to 80 &#08451 to stop enzymes activities, then cooled down to the room temperature. The length of Output-A and Output-B is 20 mer and 25 mer.

<br>
</p>
<p>
In these experimental results, the time series variation of Outputs proved that our device releases Outputs in order. The order of Outputs was controlled according to the information of input. Both graphs show that saturated time of the first and the second Output was 2 and 20 minutes. Thus, both time intervals were about 18 minutes, respectively. More than 90 % of Outputs were released from Transducer.<br>

<p>
In the <a href="discussion.html">discussion page</a>, we are going to discuss the difference between this experimental result (Fig.2) and simulation.<br>

<h3>3 Outputs releasing</h3>
<p>
We operated our device with long Input. In this experiment, we confirmed that our device releases 3 Outputs properly by preparing Input with 3 sections coding A then B then C. All Outputs are modified with TAMRA though these Outputs have a different length.<br>
Following graphs show the ratio of Outputs to the total intensity of 2 bands (Transducer, Output) on each lane.<br>

After the reaction, the temperature was heated up to 80 &#08451 to stop enzymes activities, then cooled down to the room temperature. The length of Output-A and Output-B is 20 mer and 25 mer.

<p>
Reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration, and time were determined by preliminary experiment of components reactions in advance to the experiment in the previous section. DNA strands and enzyme were carefully designed and chosen (For details, see <a href="protocol.html">Method and Material page</a>).<br>

When Input, Template, polymerase, nickase, and dNTP are all mixed together in the same solution, this process should work well, and then, Signal will be amplified.
<br>
</p>
<p>
The result of electrophoresis is shown right. 
The band of Signal appeared on both lane2 and lane3. Unlike lane1, Signal was not contained in both of them. The band of Signal appeared by the function of polymerase and nickase. Reading process works properly when the reaction temperature is 37 &#08451; ~45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, existing Output should be released by hybridization of Signal strand and displacement of polymerase.<br>
</p>
<p>
The result of electrophoresis is shown right. Output did not appear on lane1 in which Signal was not contained. Only in the presence of Signal, Output appeared on lane2 and lane3. From these results, we can conclude that Releasing process works correctly. Lane2 and lane3 differ on the reaction temperature, but the band of Output appeared on both lane2 and lane3. Releasing process would work precisely when the reaction temperature is between 37 &#08451;  and 45 &#08451; .<br>

In this process, Updater is released by both hybridization of Signal and displacement of polymerase. Recognition sequence is formed by the hybridization of Updater and Input, and then EcoRI cuts the Input.<br>

The result of electrophoresis is shown right. From the results of lane1 and lane2, we found that Updated complex and Waste were generated when Signal is entered. Therefore, it was proved that Updating process works correctly by the function of EcoRI and polymerase.<br>

<p>
3 processes with polymerase, nickase, and restriction enzyme need to work in the same H buffer as we designed. The release of first output was confirmed in this overall device. In addition, we evaluated how long would it take to release the first Output with this experiment. Therefore, enzymatic reaction times were set variously. The release of the first output corresponds to Input-AB, that is Output-A, was confirmed in this experiment. Output-A is modified with fluorescent molecule TAMRA. Before stained with SYBR Gold, a band contains Output-A (Transducer, Output) must be able to be observed.<br>
The result of electrophoresis is shown below.<br>

<p>
Fluorescent intensity of Output was increased as reaction time became longer. Output was saturated about 10 minutes later. Therefore, we concluded that it takes about 5~10 minutes for our device to release first Output.<br>
Figure below shows the result of electrophoresis above. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold.<br>

<p>
When reaction time is over 20 minutes, Signal band emerged. We thought the reason for this was because Output discharged in Releasing process saturated, and Signal exceeded. This excess Signal is used in next Updating process. <br>

It is necessary to confirm that enzyme free device we designed really releases Output depends on Input sequences in order. This experiment measures the intensity of Output-A modified with FAM. We prepared Input-AB and Input-BA.  The order of releasing would be changed depending on these Inputs if our device works properly. Following graph shows the time series variation of Output-A.<br>
</p>
<div align="center">

Fig.7 The intensity of Output-A (FAM) measured by spectrofluorometer.<br> <font size="-1">The fluorescence wavelength is 520nm. To do quantitative analysis, the highest intensity data was defined 100%, while the lowest was defined 0 %.</font><br>
</div>
<br>
<p>
According to the graph, the intensity of Output-A coded as second section was increased later than when it was coded as first section. Therefore, this result shows our device releases Output based on the order coded on Input. The time difference between first and second releasing is about 40 minutes.<br>
We are going to discuss this result along with simulation in <a href="discussion.html">Discussion page</a>.

<span><h2>Component (Seesaw gate)</h2></span>
<p>
We checked the function of one Seesaw gate by measuring fluorescence intensity and doing electrophoresis.<br>
If first Output is released, we can conclude that the Seesaw gate works properly. <br>
<br>
</p>





<span><h3 id="Measurement of fluorescence ex">Measurement of fluorescence</h3></span>
<p>
It is necessary to detect Output when it is released from Transducer. We prepared the DNA that hybridizes with Output previously modified with BHQ. 
<!--

Input is designed to release A then B. The final concentration of all components (Input, Transducer, Gate, Trigger) were 100nM.<br>
Time evolution of fluorescence is shown in following figure. We added Trigger into the solution where Input, Transducer, and Gate were mixed at 0 [s].<br>
<br>

</div>
</p>
<p>
To do quantitative analysis, we defined 100% as the fluorescence intensity level of DNA modified FAM, and 0% as the level of the solution with Input, Transducer, and Gate. After adding Trigger, strength of fluorescence increased gradually. Therefore, Output-A was released by the function of the device properly. The increase of fluorescence stopped at about 1700sec. The reaction should have ended at this point. About a half of Output strands were released according to the fluorescence intensity.<br>

In two bands appeared on lane1 and lane3 in the figure, the upper one is Transducer, and the lower one is Output. The fluorescence intensity of Output in lane1 with Trigger is stronger than that in lane3. Table.1 shows the fluorescence intensity of 2 bands in lane 1 and 3.<br>

<br>
<p>
Comparing lane1 (with Trigger) with lane3 (without Trigger), the intensity of Output increased by 83.0%, and Transducer decreased 83.0% when Trigger was added. We can conclude that Output is released by Trigger.<br>
